# PointOfSale
We used C#, ADO.NET, and MSSQL to construct the Point of Sale System project. The principal aim of this project was to design a Windows application for managing different product kinds and producing invoices. The system has an easy-to-use point-of-sale interface, effective product and inventory management, and a safe user authentication system with role-based access control. I used MSSQL queries and stored procedures and entity framework to guarantee optimal data access and integrity by utilizing ADO.NET. We have integrated a single payment system Cash on Delivery into the current system.
